## About me
My name is Kristina Yatsenko.

I am 24 years old. I studied at the University of Economics..
Several years ago, inspired by the people around me, I realized that no one could teach a person better than himself. After reading books by one of my favorite authors, Ayn Rand, I realized that the best way to live is action and creation, as well as constant self-improvement and development. Programming is one of the best areas for achieving this goal.  I used to think that this area is given only to those who have a special mindset, but now I firmly know that the basis of success is perseverance and aspiration. That is why I am here.
